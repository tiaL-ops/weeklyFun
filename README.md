This will be weekly updated project for me to practice coding.

Challenge have been generated by chatGPT so i can cahllenge myself :)

# March challenge:
Absolutely! Here’s a **March Coding Challenge Plan** for you, with one **weekly** challenge in each language (Python, Java, JavaScript, and C++). Each challenge will push your skills while keeping things **fun and practical**! 💪🔥

## **March Coding Challenge Plan**
Each challenge is **doable in a week** but can be expanded if you want. 🚀  

### **Week 1 (Python) – AI Chatbot 🤖**
💡 **Goal:** Build a simple chatbot that responds intelligently to user input using Natural Language Processing (NLP).  

#### **Features:**
- Use `NLTK` or `spaCy` for basic NLP.
- The bot should recognize **greetings**, **weather requests**, and **simple jokes**.
- If the user asks something unknown, it should respond cleverly (e.g., “I’m still learning!”).
- Add an **emotion detector** (e.g., if the user says “I’m sad,” the bot replies with encouraging words).
- (Optional) Connect it to an **API** to fetch real-time weather data.

🔧 **Extra Challenge:** Train it to recognize **custom phrases** using a dataset!

### **Week 2 (Java) – Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe (Online) 🎮**
💡 **Goal:** Build a **multiplayer** Tic-Tac-Toe game that runs over a network using **sockets**.  

#### **Features:**
- A **console-based** Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players can play over the internet.
- Use **Java Sockets** to enable communication between a **server** and **two clients**.
- Show a **real-time game board**.
- Ensure smooth **turn-taking** and error handling.

🔧 **Extra Challenge:** Add a simple **AI opponent** so the game can be played in **single-player mode** too!

### **Week 3 (JavaScript) – Real-Time Stock Price Tracker 📈**
💡 **Goal:** Build a **web-based dashboard** that fetches and displays live stock prices using an API.  

#### **Features:**
- Fetch real-time stock data from an API (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance).
- Display **dynamic charts** that update in real-time.
- Use **WebSockets** or `setInterval()` to refresh prices every few seconds.
- Include **search functionality** so users can look up different stocks.
- Style it with **Tailwind CSS** or **Bootstrap** for a sleek UI.

🔧 **Extra Challenge:** Add **news articles** related to stocks using another API!

### **Week 4 (C++) – 2D Maze Solver (Pathfinding) 🔍**
💡 **Goal:** Create a C++ program that **generates** a random maze and finds the shortest path using **BFS or A* algorithm**.  

#### **Features:**
- Use a **2D array** to represent the maze (`#` for walls, `.` for paths).
- Implement **random maze generation**.
- Use **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** or **A* Algorithm** to find the best path from **start to exit**.
- Visually display the solution in the console.
- Let the user **navigate manually** as an alternative to auto-solving.

🔧 **Extra Challenge:** Add **graphical visualization** using a library like SFML or OpenGL!
